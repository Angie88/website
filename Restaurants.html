			  <p> Your stomach will never know if you have a big budget or a small one, so when it comes to the time to eat we  have to find something that satifes our                  hunger.</p>
              <p> Fortunately, we can still say that Vancouver offers some places where you can have a feast for a small amount of money.</p>
              <h3> The pint</h3>
                 <p> It is a nice pub located on Abott street, very close to the Chinatown Skytrain Station. This place offers happy hour Monday to Friday from 3 p.m. to 6                  p.m., the happy hour consists on buying a pint of beer and get a pound of chicken wings with whatever your choice of sauce (More that 40 different                  flavors) for FREE!! </p>
              <h3> Costco Hotdogs </h3>
                  <p>Have you ever heard about these guys? Well, they have been around for a while and we are all happy about it. You can get a Costco hotdog for the   		             magnificent amount of 1.50 and it also includes a big pop!</p>
                  
              <h3> Sushi Den </h3>
               <p> Well if you thought so I was going too far with te fried stuff, I have for you a healthy option that I never forget about: Sushi Den: This sushi                  restaurant can offer you tuna rolls for just 2.00 dollars, they also have more options that you can check out. It is also located just around the                  Chinatown Station in the opposite direction of costco</p>
                <h3> Starbucks/ Tim Hortons/ Macdonalds</h3>
                  <p> I usually visit Starbucks but all the places mentioned above have the same features. 
                   WASHROOMS, WIFI and FOOD, so if you need some of that, do not hesitate on going to one of these places. In starbucks they will also give you water                   if you ask them.
                   </p>
