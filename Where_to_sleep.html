			  <p> Vancouver has  a few hostels that are ok price. They are located Dowtown and they usually have pubs around the area.</p>

			  <p> As personal experience, the only place that I tried was a hostel in UBC. They provide you a clean room and clean cover sheets, the price per night is around $30.00. It doesn't have wifi in the rooms just ethernet internet, or the free wifi option is in the lobby. </p>
			  <p>It's a safer place for your belongnings, the only disadvantage is that is far from downtown. </p>
